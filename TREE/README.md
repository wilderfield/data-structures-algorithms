# Tree (Binary Search Tree)

Fundamental data structure 
```
       8
      / \
     3    10
    / \   / \ 
   0   5 6   19
```

Data organized in a tree with a root at the top, and left / right children.

The left child is lesser than the parent, and the right child is greater than the parent

Terminal nodes are called Leaf nodes.

Need at least a head pointer to find the first item


# Disadvantage

Slow to access ith element

Need to walk through the list

Takes O(n) time (Linear time)

# Advantage

Very fast insertion and deletion

# Complexity

Access = O(n)

Search = O(n)

Insertion = O(1)

Deletion = O(1)
