# Linked Lists

Fundamental data structure 

Sequence of elements where each element links to the next element

a -> b -> c -> d

0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8


Need at least a head pointer to find the first item

Can be singly linked, or doubly linked (bi-directional)

# Disadvantage

Slow to access ith element

Need to walk through the list

Takes O(n) time (Linear time)

# Advantage

Very fast insertion and deletion
